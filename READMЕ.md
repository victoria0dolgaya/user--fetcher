User Fetcher Application

A React-based application that fetches random user data from a public API and displays current weather conditions based on each user's location.
The project consists of two main routes:

Home - fetches users, displays cards, allows saving to localStorage and viewing weather.

Saved Users - displays locally saved users, allows deletion and exporting to Google Sheets.

🎁 Bonus Functionality Implemented

The following bonus points from the test description were successfully included:

⭐️ Auto-update weather every 5 minutes

Weather modal refreshes automatically using setInterval.

⭐️ Third-party API handling with error protection

Weather API
Geocoding API
RandomUser API
Validations for coordinates & temperature

⭐️ Data export to Google Sheets

Through custom n8n automation:

Receives POST payload from the app
Inserts data into a Google Sheet
Returns status back to the FE

⭐️ Clear, production-ready code structure

Components separated
Custom Hooks (useFetch, useWeather)
Services folder for integrations
Proper error handling & UI fallbacks

🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

AI (ChatGPT/Gemini) was used strictly as an assistant for:
debugging issues with Codesandbox and Vercel deployment
improving UI/UX wording (toast messages)
writing documentation (this README)
suggesting safe patterns for error handling in hooks

All logic, structure, implementation, and code decisions were written and controlled manually by me.
No AI-generated code was copy-pasted directly without full understanding or modification.

This ensures the project reflects my own development skills, not autogenerated boilerplate.
